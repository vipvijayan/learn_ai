        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Analysis of Key Factors:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Performance:**\n",
        "- The **Multi-Query retriever** showed the highest actual context recall (0.0833) and entity recall (0.0417), indicating it retrieved the most relevant documents\n",
        "- However, overall scores are very low across all retrievers, suggesting the ground truth references in our golden dataset may not perfectly match the retriever outputs\n",
        "- The short document lengths (~50-60 tokens) make it challenging for retrievers to find exact entity matches\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Latency:**\n",
        "- **Compression (Rerank)** was the fastest at 22.96s despite making additional API calls to Cohere\n",
        "- **Multi-Query** was significantly slower at 72.90s due to generating multiple query variations with LLM calls\n",
        "- **Naive** retriever took 39.83s for straightforward vector similarity search\n",
        "- Speed differences are critical for production systems handling many queries\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Cost Considerations:**\n",
        "- **Naive & BM25**: Most cost-effective - only embedding API calls (~$0.002 per 24 queries)\n",
        "- **Multi-Query**: 3-5x more expensive due to additional LLM calls for query generation\n",
        "- **Compression (Rerank)**: Moderate cost increase for Cohere Rerank API (~$0.02 per 24 queries)\n",
        "- **Parent Document**: Higher embedding costs due to chunking strategy\n",
        "- **Ensemble**: Multiplied costs as it runs all constituent retrievers\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "For this **short-document use case data** (project descriptions of 50-60 tokens):\n",
        "\n",
        "**Best Choice: Naive Retriever**\n",
        "- **Why:** Provides the best balance of actual performance (0.0417 recall), reasonable latency (39.83s), and lowest cost\n",
        "- The Compression (Rerank) won on aggregate score primarily due to speed, but showed 0.0000 recall, suggesting it may be over-filtering relevant documents\n",
        "- For short documents where semantic meaning is concentrated, simple cosine similarity performs adequately\n",
        "\n",
        "**Alternative for Production:**\n",
        "If budget allows and latency is acceptable, **Multi-Query retriever** should be considered:\n",
        "- Highest actual recall metrics (2x better than Naive)\n",
        "- Generates diverse query perspectives that help with vocabulary mismatch\n",
        "- Worth the 2x latency cost for critical applications where recall is paramount\n",
        "\n",
        "**Not Recommended:**\n",
        "- **Compression (Rerank)**: Despite being fastest, 0.0000 recall suggests it's too aggressive for short documents\n",
        "- **Ensemble**: Incomplete evaluation, but would multiply costs without clear benefit given low base scores\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Takeaway:** The evaluation reveals that short documents are challenging for advanced retrieval methods. The simplest approaches (Naive, BM25) perform comparably to complex methods at a fraction of the cost. For production, start with Naive retrieval and monitor performance before investing in more expensive solutions."
