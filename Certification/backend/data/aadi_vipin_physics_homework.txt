Chapter 4: Applications of Newton's Laws

Reading Assignment:
Read sections 4.1-4.4 in your textbook, focusing on:
- Free body diagrams
- Normal force and friction
- Applications of Newton's second law
- Connected objects and pulleys

Problems to Solve:

Newton's First Law:
1. A book sits on a table. Draw a free body diagram and explain why the book remains at rest.
2. A hockey puck slides across ice with constant velocity. What can you conclude about the net force?

Newton's Second Law:
3. A 5.0 kg box is pushed across a floor with a force of 20 N. If the coefficient of friction is 0.15, what is the acceleration?
4. Calculate the tension in a rope used to pull a 15 kg sled up a 30° incline at constant speed. (μ = 0.20)
5. Two objects (m₁ = 3.0 kg, m₂ = 7.0 kg) are connected by a rope over a pulley. Find the acceleration of the system.

Newton's Third Law:
6. A person walks across a floor. Identify the action-reaction pairs involved.
7. Explain why a rocket can accelerate in space where there is no air to "push against."

Problem-Solving Steps:
1. Draw a clear diagram
2. Identify all forces acting on each object
3. Draw free body diagrams
4. Apply Newton's laws
5. Solve algebraically before substituting numbers
6. Check your answer for reasonableness

Word Problems:
8. A 1200 kg car accelerates from rest to 25 m/s in 8.0 seconds. Calculate the net force required.
9. A 65 kg skier slides down a 25° slope. If the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.10, find the acceleration.
10. An elevator with a mass of 800 kg carries passengers with a total mass of 300 kg. What force must the motor provide to accelerate upward at 2.0 m/s²?

Laboratory Connection:
Review your data from last week's friction lab. Use your measured coefficient of friction to solve problem #3 with your actual experimental values.

Study Tips:
- Practice drawing free body diagrams for each problem
- Remember that friction always opposes motion
- Weight and normal force are not always equal
- Break forces into components for inclined planes

Teacher Notes:
Aadi, your work on kinematics problems was very good. These Newton's law problems require careful attention to force directions and free body diagrams. Take your time with the diagrams - they're the key to solving these problems correctly. Your lab work shows you understand the concepts, now apply that understanding to these calculations.
