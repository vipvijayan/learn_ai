Teacher Notes:
Aadi, your previous reading responses showed good analytical thinking. I particularly liked your observations about symbolism in "The Pearl." For this assignment, push yourself to make deeper connections between the text and the historical context. Don't just summarize - analyze and interpret what Steinbeck is trying to say.

Remember to support your ideas with specific evidence from the text.
