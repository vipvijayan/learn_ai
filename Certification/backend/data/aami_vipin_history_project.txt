Teacher Notes:
Aami, your passion for historical analysis really shows in your work. This topic will allow you to explore multiple civilizations and their interconnections. Consider focusing on specific examples rather than trying to cover everything. Your work on the Renaissance project was exceptional in its depth of analysis.

Research resources available in school library and through online databases. See me during office hours (Tuesdays 3:30-4:30) if you need help with primary sources.
