            "Response: The \"Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem\" refers to a situation where a CEO who previously excelled in a specific function or specialty ends up hiring a weak executive to run that same function after becoming CEO. This problem arises because the CEO has difficulty letting go of the function that originally established their success, and as a result, deliberately or inadvertently hires someone weak in that role so that the CEO can continue to be \"the man\" in that area. An example given is Michael Eisner, the CEO of Disney, who had been a brilliant TV network executive but when he bought ABC, the network fell to fourth place. Eisner's response was that if he had more time, he could have turned ABC around himself, illustrating his reluctance to fully relinquish control to a strong executive. This problem highlights the risk of undermining the function's leadership due to the CEO's grip on the area that made them successful ([Source 1]).\n",
