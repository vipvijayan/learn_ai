            "Response: The \"Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem\" refers to a situation where a CEO or startup founder hires a weak executive to run the function or specialty that the CEO themselves used to manage. This often happens because the CEO has difficulty letting go of the function that brought them success—and hence hires someone weak in that area so they can continue to maintain control or be \"the man\" in that role. The term is named after Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who had previously been a brilliant TV network executive but, after purchasing ABC, saw it fall to fourth place. Eisner's response was that if he had an extra two days a week, he could turn ABC around himself; however, he didn't have that time to do so, illustrating how trying to control or weak hiring in one's specialty can be a problem (Source 1).\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **PDF Text Extraction**: \n",
        "   - ✅ Page-by-page text extraction with error handling\n",
        "   - ✅ Comprehensive metadata capture (title, author, creation date, etc.)\n",
        "   - ✅ Content length tracking and page numbering\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Advanced Chunking**: \n",
        "   - ✅ Overlapping chunks for better context preservation\n",
        "   - ✅ Page-aware splitting maintains document structure\n",
        "   - ✅ Metadata inheritance from pages to chunks\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Enhanced Search**:\n",
        "   - ✅ Euclidean distance for semantic similarity\n",
        "   - ✅ Page and chunk number attribution\n",
        "   - ✅ Relevance scoring with distance metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Metadata Preservation**:\n",
        "   - ✅ Document-level metadata (title, author, pages)\n",
        "   - ✅ Page-level metadata (page numbers, content length)\n",
        "   - ✅ Chunk-level metadata (positions, chunk numbers)\n",
