Education is a major use case for ChatGPT. 10.2% of all user\\nmessages and 36% of Practical Guidance messages are requests for Tutoring or Teaching. Another\\nlarge share - 8.5% in total and 30% of Practical Guidance - is general how-to advice on a variety\\nof topics. Technical Help includes Computer Programming (4.2% of messages), Mathematical Calcu-\\nlations (3%), and Data Analysis (0.4%).

In contrast, Zao-Sanders (2025) estimates that Therapy/Companionship is\\nthe most prevalent use case for generative AI.9\\nWe also document several important facts about demographic variation in ChatGPT usage. First,\\nwe show evidence that the gender gap in ChatGPT usage has likely narrowed considerably over time,\\nand may have closed completely. In the few months after ChatGPT was released about 80% of active\\nusers had typically masculine first names.10 However, that number declined to 48% as of June 2025,\\nwith active users slightly more likely to have typically feminine first names. Second, we find that\\nnearly half of all messages sent by adults were sent by users under the age of 26, although age gaps\\nhave narrowed somewhat in recent months. Third, we find that ChatGPT usage has grown relatively\\nfaster in low- and middle-income countries over the last year. Fourth, we find that educated users and\\nusers in highly-paid professional occupations are substantially more likely to use ChatGPT for work.\\nWe introduce a new taxonomy to classify messages according to the kind of output the user is\\nseeking, using a simple rubric that we call Asking, Doing, or Expressing.11\\nAsking is when the\\nuser is seeking information or clarification to inform a decision, corresponding to problem-solving\\nmodels of knowledge work (e.g., Garicano (2000); Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006); Carnehl and\\nSchneider (2025); Ide and Talamas (2025)). Doing is when the user wants to produce some output\\nor perform a particular task, corresponding to classic task-based models of work (e.g., Autor et al.\\n(2003)). Expressing is when the user is expressing views or feelings but not seeking any information or\\naction. We estimate that about 49% of messages are Asking, 40% are Doing, and 11% are Expressing.\\nHowever, as of July 2025 about 56% of work-related messages are classified as Doing (e.g., performing\\njob tasks), and nearly three-quarters of those are Writing tasks. The relative frequency of writing-\\nrelated conversations is notable for two reasons. First, writing is a task that is common to nearly all\\nwhite-collar jobs, and good written communication skills are among the top “soft” skills demanded by\\nemployers (National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2024). Second, one distinctive feature of\\ngenerative AI, relative to other information technologies, is its ability to produce long-form outputs\\nsuch as writing and software code.\\nWe also map message content to work activities using the Occupational Information Network\\n(O*NET), a survey of job characteristics supported by the U.S. Department of Labor. We find that\\nabout 81% of work-related messages are associated with two broad work activities: 1) obtaining,\\ndocumenting, and interpreting information; and 2) making decisions, giving advice, solving problems,\\nand thinking creatively. Additionally, we find that the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage\\nare highly similar across very different kinds of occupations. For example, the work activities Getting\\nInformation and Making Decisions and Solving Problems are in the top five of message frequency in\\nnearly all occupations, ranging from management and business to STEM to administrative and sales\\noccupations.\\nOverall, we find that information-seeking and decision support are the most common ChatGPT\\nuse cases in most jobs. This is consistent with the fact that almost half of all ChatGPT usage is'),\n",

       " 'response': 'The average person uses AI primarily for writing conversations, often requesting modifications to their inputs rather than creating new content. Education is a major use case, with about 10.2% of all user messages and 36% of Practical Guidance messages related to tutoring or teaching. Additionally, users seek general how-to advice on various topics, accounting for around 8.5% overall and 30% of Practical Guidance messages. Technical help, such as computer programming, mathematical calculations, and data analysis, also constitutes a smaller share. Users engage with AI for self-expression, including relationships, personal reflection, and games, though these represent a smaller portion of interactions. Overall, most usage involves information-seeking, practical guidance, and producing digital content like writing, software code, and spreadsheets, often tailored to individual needs.'}"

Additionally, users frequently request general how-to advice on a wide range of topics.\\n\\n2. **Writing Assistance**: The majority of work-related messages involve writing, where many users ask for help in modifying existing text rather than creating new content from scratch. This highlights the use of AI in improving the quality of their writing.\\n\\n3. **Technical Help**: Users utilize AI for various technical supports, including computer programming, mathematical calculations, and data analysis.\\n\\n4. **Non-Work Usage**: Over 70% of queries to ChatGPT are unrelated to work. This includes personal reflection, relationships, games, and role play, alongside other forms of self-expression.\\n\\n5. **Decision Support and Research**: AI helps with decision-making and research, particularly in knowledge-intensive jobs. It acts as a supportive tool rather than just a task completer, thereby improving worker output.\\n\\n6. **Creative and Personal Development**: Users leverage AI for creative writing, personal development, and as advisors, aiding in their personal and professional lives by providing customized guidance and accessible knowledge.\\n\\nOverall, AI contributes to improved decision-making, personalized support, and enhanced quality of life, resulting in significant welfare gains for its users.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, name='HowPeopleUseAIRetriever')]}}\n",

In this report, we will explore the current state of context engineering and its implications for the utilization of AI technologies across different applications.\\n\\n#### What is Context Engineering?\\nContext engineering is defined as the process of systematically organizing, assembling, and optimizing the context information provided to LLMs. This process ensures that AI systems can understand and perform tasks more effectively by supplying them with the necessary background knowledge, instructions, and tools. Contrary to traditional prompt engineering, which primarily focuses on crafting effective input prompts, context engineering expands to dynamic systems capable of managing information over longer conversations and multi-turn interactions.\\n\\n#### Key Developments in Context Engineering\\n1. **Dynamic Systems**: By 2025, LLM applications have transitioned from simple, single-prompt interactions to complex, dynamic systems that can engage in prolonged dialogues. This evolution necessitates an adeptness in context engineering to enable LLMs to keep track of previous inputs and manage multi-turn communication effectively.\\n\\n2. **Persistent Memory Mechanisms**: Innovations in agent-based LLM models have introduced persistent memory and adaptive reasoning capabilities, enhancing how these systems recall information from earlier interactions. Such improvements minimize errors previously attributed to the lack of context or tooling.\\n\\n3. **Optimization for Real-World Applications**: Context engineering is vital for applications requiring high accuracy, such as technical documentation processing and data interpretation. Companies like Anthropic have leveraged expanded context windows in their Claude models, allowing for more data-intensive applications and improved task performance.\\n\\n4. **Benchmarking Performance**: Studies indicate that employing structured context has resulted in significant performance enhancements in LLMs. For instance, systematic context engineering practices have led to improvements of over 13% in task accuracy by providing clearer and more effective frameworks for data interpretation.\\n\\n#### Impact on AI Usage\\nThe rise of context engineering has transformed how organizations and individuals approach AI technologies:\\n\\n- **Enhanced Decision-Making**: Businesses utilizing LLMs equipped with robust context engineering are making more informed decisions based on clearer insights from automated systems. For example, in fields like customer support, having context-rich dialogues allows for quicker and more accurate resolutions.\\n\\n- **Multi-Use Applications**: With the ability to process complex interactions, LLMs are increasingly being integrated into workflows that span multiple use cases, from education to healthcare, thereby broadening the scope of AI utility.\\n\\n- **Reduction of Errors**: The strategic focus on context has shifted the landscape, where many errors cited in previous LLM models were due to insufficient context. By minimizing these context-level mistakes, AI engineers can concentrate on improving overall model efficacy.\\n\\n- **Empowering AI Engineers**: The demand for context engineering skills is rising, positioning it as one of the most critical areas of expertise in AI development. Successful AI engineers must now master the science of providing context that aligns with user expectations and task requirements.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nIn 2025, context engineering has firmly established itself as a vital component of effective LLM implementation and usage. As AI systems grow more sophisticated, the ability to construct and manage context effectively will be paramount for successful AI interaction. Organizations that invest in developing these capabilities will gain a competitive edge, leveraging AI to achieve more precise outcomes and foster innovative applications across various fields.

    "### Report on the Rise of Context Engineering in the LLM Space in 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "As we move further into 2025, the landscape of artificial intelligence continues to evolve, particularly in the domain of large language models (LLMs). One significant trend emerging is \"context engineering,\" which has begun to outpace the earlier focus on prompt engineering. This report explores how context engineering is reshaping the dynamics of AI usage, enhancing the capabilities of LLMs to perform complex tasks, and ultimately influencing the way users interact with AI technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Emergence of Context Engineering\n",
    "In previous years, prompt engineering involved crafting inputs to guide LLMs to generate desired outputs. However, by 2025, the limitations of traditional prompt engineering have become evident, especially as applications require more dynamic interactions and multi-turn dialogues. Context engineering has emerged as a new paradigm, prioritizing the construction of strategies and systems that enable LLMs to access and utilize extensive contextual information effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern LLMs, such as GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3, now boast context windows that can handle up to 1 million tokens. This substantial increase allows these models to grasp more extensive content, such as books or lengthy documents, fundamentally changing what they can achieve in real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Developments in Context Engineering\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Knowledge Management**: The shift towards context engineering facilitates more sophisticated knowledge management within AI systems. These systems now use persistent memory and adaptive reasoning, enabling them to maintain context across interactions. For example, agent-based LLMs can now engage in workflows requiring multiple exchanges, which is vital for complex applications requiring follow-ups and extended dialogues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improved Context Lengths**: Advances in transformer architectures have led to the possibility of extending native context lengths dramatically. As a result, LLMs can process larger datasets directly, enhancing their capacity to deliver accurate and relevant outputs without extensive re-prompting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Context Compression and Retrieval**: Techniques such as context compression, where information is stored externally or synthesized to maximize relevance, are gaining traction. Methods identified in recent studies highlight the importance of integrating efficient retrieval systems and summarization techniques to make the most of the available context.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The Rise of Multi-Agent Systems**: In 2025, LLM applications are increasingly shifting towards multi-agent architectures, where different AI agents work collaboratively, leveraging various tools and pieces of information to improve output accuracy and reduce operational inefficiencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Impact on AI Usage\n",
    "The implications of context engineering are far-reaching and transformative for users and organizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Enterprises adopting context engineering report accuracy rates of 90-95%, a significant improvement over the 65-75% typically associated with earlier methods. This rise in performance is generating more trust in AI systems across various sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faster Deployment and Cost Efficiency**: Organizations employing structured context engineering have demonstrated a 3x increase in the speed of bringing AI solutions to production and a 40% reduction in operational costs compared to traditional prompt-based methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adaptability and Scalability**: Context-engineered systems are inherently more adaptable, allowing businesses to scale AI applications rapidly in response to evolving needs without overhauling the underlying architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Augmentation of Human Intelligence**: As context engineering allows AI systems to interact in more meaningful ways, they are increasingly positioned as partners in decision-making processes, rather than mere tools. This evolution enhances the collaborative potential between humans and AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "The rise of context engineering marks a critical turning point in the development and application of LLMs. As AI systems become increasingly capable of managing and utilizing complex contextual information, they are set to enhance user experiences, improve efficiency, and drive new innovations across industries. Organizations that embrace this trend will likely lead the charge into a future where AI is not just a tool for automation but a collaborative partner in problem-solving and creativity."
