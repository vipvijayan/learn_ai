# Alternative Deployment Solutions

Since Vercel deployment protection is blocking access at the account level, here are alternative deployment options:

## Option 1: Netlify Deployment

### Steps:
1. Install Netlify CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. Deploy the app:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/vipinvijayan/Developer/projects/AI/AIMakerSpace/code/learn_ai_0/assig_1
   netlify deploy --dir . --prod
   ```

## Option 2: GitHub Pages (Static Only)

### Steps:
1. Push to GitHub repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Set source to root directory

## Option 3: Railway.app

### Steps:
1. Install Railway CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. Deploy:
   ```bash
   railway login
   railway deploy
   ```

## Option 4: Render.com

### Steps:
1. Create account at render.com
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Deploy as static site + web service
