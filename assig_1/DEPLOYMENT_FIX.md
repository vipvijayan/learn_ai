# Deployment Instructions

## The Issue
The 404 error you're encountering is due to Vercel Deployment Protection being enabled, which requires authentication to access the deployed application.

## Quick Fix
1. Visit: https://vercel.com/vipin-vijayan-nairs-projects/assig-1/settings/security
2. Under "Deployment Protection", turn OFF the toggle
3. Save the changes

## Your Deployed URLs
- **Main**: https://assig-1-gj69h147n-vipin-vijayan-nairs-projects.vercel.app
- **Alias 1**: https://assig-1.vercel.app  
- **Alias 2**: https://assig-1-vipin-vijayan-nairs-projects.vercel.app

## Verification
After disabling protection, you should be able to:
1. Visit any of the URLs above
2. See your React chat interface
3. Use the `/api/chat` and `/api/health` endpoints

## Status
✅ **Backend**: Successfully deployed as serverless functions
✅ **Frontend**: Successfully built and deployed
✅ **Routing**: Configured correctly
⚠️  **Access**: Blocked by deployment protection (easily fixable)

The deployment itself is completely successful - just needs the protection setting adjusted!
