```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "api/app.py", "use": "@vercel/python" },
    { "src": "frontend/package.json", "use": "@vercel/static-build", "config": { "distDir": "build" } }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "/api/app.py" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/frontend/build/$1" }
  ]
}
```

### API Routes
- `POST /api/chat` - AI chat endpoint
- `GET /api/health` - Health check

## Deployment Commands

```bash
# Initial deployment
vercel

# Production deployment
vercel --prod

# Check deployment status
vercel ls
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the live application**: Visit the production URL
2. **Monitor performance**: Use Vercel dashboard for analytics
3. **Set up custom domain** (optional): Through Vercel dashboard
4. **Configure environment variables**: For production OpenAI API keys
5. **Set up CI/CD**: Connect GitHub for automatic deployments

## Notes

- Frontend uses relative URLs (`/api/chat`) which are routed by Vercel
- Backend runs as serverless functions (no persistent server needed)
- CORS is configured to allow requests from any origin
- Build process is automated through Vercel's build system

ðŸŽ‰ **Deployment Successful!** The application is now live and accessible worldwide.
