    "The process of embedding is typically very time consuming and expensive:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Send text to OpenAI API endpoint\n",
    "2. Wait for processing  \n",
    "3. Receive response\n",

    "**Our Caching Solution:**\n",
    "1. Check local cache for previously computed embeddings\n",
    "2. If found: Return cached vector (instant, free)\n",
    "3. If not found: Call OpenAI API, store result in cache\n",
    "4. Return vector representation\n",
    "\n",

    "**Benefits:**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Simple Agent:**\n",
    "- Fast, cheap, predictable\n",
    "- No self-correction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helpfulness Agent:**\n",
    "- Higher quality, self-correcting\n",
    "- Slower, more expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use:**\n",
    "- Simple: High-volume, cost-sensitive, straightforward queries\n",
    "- Helpfulness: Customer-facing, accuracy-critical, complex tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Latency:**\n",
    "- Helpfulness check adds 1-3s per refinement cycle\n",
    "- Each iteration = additional LLM call\n",
    "- Use async processing to minimize user-facing delay\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost:**\n",
    "- Refinement can 2-3x API costs (multiple LLM calls)\n",
    "- Set max refinement limits (e.g., 2-3 iterations)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monitoring:**\n",
    "- Track: response time, iteration count, success rate\n",
    "- Use LangSmith for trace analysis\n",
    "- Set up alerts for high latency/cost patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalability:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**High Concurrent Load:**\n",
    "- Simple Agent: Handles more concurrent users (faster, less resource-heavy)\n",
    "- Helpfulness Agent: Needs more resources (queue requests, add load balancers)\n",
    "- Use async/await to avoid blocking\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caching Strategies:**\n",
    "- Simple Agent: Cache embeddings + frequent queries (fast lookups)\n",
    "- Helpfulness Agent: Cache final refined responses + evaluation results\n",
    "- Both: Use Redis for distributed caching across servers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rate Limiting & Circuit Breakers:**\n",
    "- Rate limiting: Limit requests per user (e.g., 10/minute) to prevent API overload\n",
    "- Circuit breaker: Auto-stop calling OpenAI if error rate > 50%, retry after cooldown\n",
    "- Implement with libraries like `tenacity` or API gateway tools"

    "\n",
    "**Your Mission**: Enhance the existing LangGraph agent by adding a **Guardrails validation node** that ensures all interactions are safe, on-topic, and compliant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**📋 Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Guardrails Node**: \n",
    "   - Implement input validation (jailbreak, topic, PII detection)\n",
    "   - Implement output validation (content moderation, factuality)\n",
    "   - Handle guard failures gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integrate with Agent Workflow**:\n",
    "   - Add guards as a pre-processing step\n",
    "   - Add guards as a post-processing step  \n",
    "   - Implement refinement loops for failed validations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test with Adversarial Scenarios**:\n",
    "   - Test jailbreak attempts\n",
    "   - Test off-topic queries\n",
    "   - Test inappropriate content generation\n",
    "   - Test PII leakage scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Success Criteria:**\n",
    "- Agent blocks malicious inputs while allowing legitimate queries\n",
    "- Agent produces safe, factual, on-topic responses\n",
    "- System gracefully handles edge cases and provides helpful error messages\n",
    "- Performance remains acceptable with guard overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Implementation Hints:**\n",
    "- Use LangGraph's conditional routing for guard decisions\n",
    "- Implement both synchronous and asynchronous guard validation\n",
    "- Add comprehensive logging for security monitoring\n",
    "- Consider guard performance vs security trade-offs\n"

      "🤖 Agent: Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans are federal student loan repayment options designed to make your monthly payments more manageable based on your income and family size. These plans can be beneficial for borrowers who may be struggling to make their standard monthly payments. Here’s an overview of how IDR plans work:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Features of IDR Plans:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Payment Calculation**: Your monthly payment is capped at a percentage of your discretionary income, which is calculated based on your income and family size. The percentage varies depending on the specific IDR plan you choose.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Loan Forgiveness**: If you remain in an IDR plan and make qualifying payments for a certain number of years (typically 20 or 25 years), the remaining loan balance may be forgiven. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Annual Recertification**: You must recertify your income and family size each year to remain on an IDR plan. This is important because your payment amount can change based on your income.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Types of IDR Plans**:\n",
      "   - **Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) Plan**: Caps payments at 10% of discretionary income and offers forgiveness after 20 years for undergraduate loans and 25 years for graduate loans.\n",
      "   - **Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Plan**: Also caps payments at 10% of discretionary income, with forgiveness after 20 years. Eligibility is more limited than REPAYE.\n",
      "   - **Income-Based Repayment (IBR) Plan**: Caps payments at 10% or 15% of discretionary income depending on when you borrowed, with forgiveness after 20 or 25 years.\n",
      "   - **Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) Plan**: Caps payments at the lesser of 20% of discretionary income or what you would pay on a fixed repayment plan over 12 years, with forgiveness after 25 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Eligibility:\n",
      "To qualify for IDR plans, you must have federal student loans. Private loans are not eligible. Each plan may have specific eligibility requirements, so it's essential to check the details for the plan you are considering.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How to Apply:\n",
      "You can apply for an IDR plan through your loan servicer. The application typically involves providing information about your income and family size, and you may need to submit documentation such as tax returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Considerations:\n",
      "- IDR plans can offer significant relief if you’re facing financial hardship, but the balance forgiven may be considered taxable income under current tax laws.\n",
      "- It’s important to evaluate your financial situation and explore all repayment options to determine which plan is best for you.\n",
